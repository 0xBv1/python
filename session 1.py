# set's write our first Python file, called helloworld.py, which can be done in any text editor.
print("Hello, World!")

# Variables in Python:
x = 5
y = "Hello, World!"

# Comments in Python:

#This is a comment.
print("Hello, World!")

print("Hello, World!") #This is a comment

#This is a comment
#written in
#more than just one line
print("Hello, World!")


# Since Python will ignore string literals that are not assigned to a variable, you can add a multiline string (triple quotes) in your code, and place your comment inside it:

# Example
"""
This is a comment
written in
more than just one line
"""
print("Hello, World!")

# Creating Variables
# A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
x = 5
y = "John"
print(x)
print(y)

# Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set.
name = "Python"
print("I love", name)

# Taking user input
name = input("What is your name? ")

#  Displaying user input
print("Hello, " + name + "! Nice to meet you.")
